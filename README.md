# connect-four

The goal of this project was to design the game Connect Four using TDD utilizing rspec!

The game itself and the logic contained inside was pretty easy, because it was similar
to other games I have built before, but took a little time making sure the win methods
were done correctly and efficiently, so as to not waste as much time or processing checking
for each win.

As far as the TDD is concerned with rspec, I think I need a little more practice still, 
as I still found myself having a difficult time coming up with some of the tests due to
differences between mocks and stubs and doubles, but feel confident that I ultimately
designed the tests well and made sure they caught anything I could think of!

Had fun doing this project!
